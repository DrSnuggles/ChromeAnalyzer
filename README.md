## Why a copy?

I did a simplyfied version because i got lots of errors while "compile".

"Compile" also needed >100MB of additional node_modules.

I just wanted that nice looking 3D Sonogram for another project and i wanted it small and easy to use.

So my goal was to reduce it and get rid of JQuery because it was mostly used to access UI elements.
